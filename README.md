## üöÄ Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Docker
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python (for backend)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. Open the Project in VS Code
   - Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Set Up OpenAI API Key
   - Add your OpenAI API key to var.env:
      ```env
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
      ```
3. Set Up Dev Containers
   - Download the Dev Containers extension in VS Code.
   - Press CMD + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux).
   - Choose Rebuild and Reopen in Container.
   - The docker-compose.devcontainer.yml file will launch the environment, mounting the local code into the container.

4. Run the Backend
   - Open a terminal inside the dev container.
   - Run the following command:
      ```bash
      uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
      ```
   - The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:8001.

5. Run the Frontend
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
   - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
   - Build the frontend:
      ```bash
      npm build
      ```
   - Start the frontend server:
      ```bash
      npm run start
      ```
     
   - The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

6. Add Stories to MongoDB
   - Inside the dev container, open a terminal.
   - Run the following command to import data into MongoDB:
      ```bash
      python -m backend.import_data
      ```
     

### Additional Notes
- Ensure Docker is running before setting up the dev container.
- If you encounter issues, check the logs in the terminal or restart the dev container.
